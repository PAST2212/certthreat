# certthreat

As a Supplement to my other Project: https://github.com/PAST2212/domainthreat

Using CERT Transparency Logs https://github.com/CaliDog/certstream-python to monitor phishing domains or brand impersonations. This is interesting to find newly domain registrations that are not published on a daily base by domain authorities  (e.g. DENIC does not publish domains with .de TLD - ICANN does publish .com domains).

**You can recognize:**
- combo squatting (e.g. amazon-shop.com), 
- typo squatting (ammazon.com), 
- brand impersonations, 
- phishing attacks (e.g. CEO-Fraud),
- and other forms of phishing websites / look-alike Domains (e.g. ùóâayùûÄal.com - greek letter RHO 'ùûÄ' instead of latin letter 'p')

**Features**:
- False Positive Reduction Instruments (e.g. self defined Blacklists, Thresholds depending on string lenght)
- IDN / Homoglyph Detection
- CSV Export ("Ubuntu\home\User\Desktop" path is default path to create output)
- Find domains and **Subdomains** that are identical or confusingly similar to your name/brand/mailing domain name/etc 
- Mix of Edit-based and Token-based textdistance algorithms to increase result quality by considering degree of freedom in choosing variations of domain - names from attacker side
- Domain Registrar and Domain Creation Date WHOIS as well as RDAP lookups are included.
- Possibility to change pre-defined thresholds of fuzzy-matching algorithms if you want to

Put your brands or mailing domain names into this list for monitoring operations (without the TLD).

Put here common word collisions you want to exclude from the results to reduce false positives.
